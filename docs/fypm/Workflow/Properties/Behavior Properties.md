## TYPE
##### Habit
A task with `Habit` has a recurrence setting and must have `STATE` set to `Time`. This type of task means that it is a habit, something that you must do every day (either automatically or consciously) and that can be counted.
##### Objective
##### Eventual
A task with `Eventual` type means that it will be done on the same day that it was entered. That type of task is reserved to tasks you didn't know you needed to do. Useful to unplanned meetings, quick tasks, etc.
##### Continuous
A task that has its `TYPE` set to `Continuous` will never be completed. Continuous tasks need to be... Continuous. This type of task serves as a counter, a good use case is to create a task like "Minecraft" to know how long you have played in total.
- You can also use `taconls` to see all continuous tasks.
##### Event
That type of task is useful to schedule commemorative dates or automatic payments. A task with `Event` type must accompany a `WT` set to `AllDay`, otherwise it can simply be a `Check` task. This type of task need a day to be completed, and the time that will be setted is always "23:59:59" in the day that was defined.
##### SubTask
##### Check
Unlike the `Habit` type, this type does not come with a `STATE` defined as `Time`, but rather defined as `Info`. This has the same logic as Habit, but it is not possible to start this type of task. Useful for statistical tasks like "Sleep on time", "2000 calories", etc.
