## Effort

The `effort` property specifies the effort exerted to perform a task. Its purpose is to indicate how much difficulty I find in doing something, not necessarily how difficult the task is.

#### Values
**5** - It challenges me and has a high potential to drain my energy.
> *Examples: Study a difficult topic, play chess with too much concentration, difficult workouts, read more than 50 pages of books (or with a difficult topic).*

**4** - A classification of tasks that must be well selected. Because if there are too many of them, I will be very tired. These are usually important tasks.
> *Examples: Clean the house, organize workflow, make code, solve social problems, craftsmanship.*

**3** - Medium effort, probably won't tire me, but it takes a considerable amount of time and can't be done automatically.
> *Examples: Read newsletters, write report note, do laundry, organize my room.*

**2** - There is some difficulty, but for me, it is easy (example are manual/automated tasks or tasks that are already a habit). It can include passive tasks too (like videos).
> *Examples: Make meals, make playlists, answer people on social media.*

**1** - It has minimal effort, can even be completed in less than 5 minutes or is a Dionysian/rest task.
> *Examples: Watch Anime, lock house, active some gadget (like mosquitoes repellent).*

**0** - Without a fixed value, the effort can vary from small to high values (*please use this sparingly*).
> *Examples*:
